# NIBBLES clone

Can anyone remember [MS-DOS][msdos], [Q-Basic][qbasic] and/or [Turbo Pascal][pascal]?
There were some little games called [Nibbles][uvl-nibbles] and [Ramona das Apfelw√ºrmchen][uvl-ramona].
This repository is a clone of this type of games written in Java using my little 2d graphics
engine library [PixelARTillery2D][pixelartillery].

If you want to play the original Nibbles, you can try the following link:
